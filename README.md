### License
dandelion\* is released under GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (see [LICENCE](https://github.com/Diaspora-for-Android/dandelion/blob/master/LICENSE.md)).

### WebApp
The app is developed as a WebApp because currently diaspora\* doesn't have an API that can be used to create a native interface to retrieve the user's data, publications, direct messages and so on. That's why there are only WebApps for diaspora\* out there.  
[Stay tuned on diaspora\* issues](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/labels/api) about API.

Why is a WebApp better than using the mobile site on a browser?  
Basically it provides better integration with the system (events coming into and going out of the app), notifications, customized interface and functions and a nice little icon that takes you directly to your favorite social network :)

### Device Requirements
The minimum Android version supported is Jelly Bean, Android v4.2.0 / API 17

### App Permissions
dandelion\* requires access to the Internet and to external storage to be able to upload photos when creating a new post and for taking screenshots.
